👕 Garment Worker Productivity Prediction

This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model to predict the productivity of garment workers based on various operational metrics. The model is served via a lightweight Python Flask web application.

🌟 Project Goal and Features

The objective is to provide an analytical tool that uses historical data to forecast worker efficiency.

    Prediction Target: Garment Worker Productivity Classification (e.g., Target Met/Not Met).
    
    Modeling: Uses a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) trained on features like work-in-progress, idle time, and actual vs. required effort.                                                                                                                                                
    
    Deployment: The trained model is saved using pickle and loaded into a Flask server for real-time inference.
